.. py:class:: BiosphereDatabase

   Bases: :py:obj:`Database`


   Class to import biosphere3 database, which is the Brightway database containing all
   biosphere flows. Biosphere flows are used to compute impacts thanks to
   characterization factors. This class currently works only with EcoInvent 3.9.

   Initializes a Database from its name and optionally its path.
   :param name: name of the database. Should be consistent with the name used in
   datasets.
   :param path: path of the database on disk.


   .. py:method:: execute_at_startup() -> None

      Method to be executed when running Appa Build to import the database. Default
      behavior is to reset all params, and to run import method only if its not
      already present in Brightway project.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: import_in_project() -> None

      Import the database in Brightway project.
      :return:



.. py:class:: Database(name: str, path: Optional[str])

   Abstract class of a Database. Defines two mandatory methods for import.

   Initializes a Database from its name and optionally its path.
   :param name: name of the database. Should be consistent with the name used in
   datasets.
   :param path: path of the database on disk.


   .. py:method:: execute_at_startup() -> None

      Method to be executed when running Appa Build to import the database. Default
      behavior is to reset all params, and to run import method only if its not
      already present in Brightway project.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: import_in_project() -> None
      :abstractmethod:


      Import the database in Brightway project.
      :return:



   .. py:attribute:: name


   .. py:attribute:: path


.. py:class:: EcoInventDatabase(name, path)

   Bases: :py:obj:`Database`


   Abstract class of a Database. Defines two mandatory methods for import.

   Initializes a Database from its name and optionally its path.
   :param name: name of the database. Should be consistent with the name used in
   datasets.
   :param path: path of the database on disk.


   .. py:method:: import_in_project()

      Import the database in Brightway project.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: validate()

      Checks the eco invent database exists and is valid.
      If not the program exits with the exit code 1.



.. py:class:: ForegroundDatabase(name, path)

   Bases: :py:obj:`Database`


   Handles foreground data. Use datasets must have .json, .yaml or .yml extension to
   be imported. Dataset uuid is dataset file's name without extension.

   Initializes a UserDatabase from its name, its path, its reference flow, and
   parameters if any.
   Reference flow has to be specified as import is done in a tree way with
   reference flow as a root.
   :param name: user database name
   :param path: user datasets location



   .. py:method:: execute_at_build_time()


   .. py:method:: execute_at_startup()

      Method to be executed when running Appa Build to import the database. Default
      behavior is to reset all params, and to run import method only if its not
      already present in Brightway project.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: find_activities_on_disk() -> None

      Scans database's path to import every matching file as a SerializedActivity.
      Results are stored in object's context.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: import_in_project() -> None

      Import user database in Brightway project. Database is declared as foreground
      for lca_algebraic.
      This method will transform each used dataset from SerializedActivity and
      SerializedExchange to Activity and Exchange objects.
      Parameters are then propagated from the reference flow to the leaf activities.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: set_functional_unit(fu_name: str, parameters: apparun.parameters.ImpactModelParams)


   .. py:attribute:: context


   .. py:attribute:: fu_name
      :value: ''



   .. py:attribute:: parameters
      :value: None



.. py:class:: ImpactProxiesDatabase

   Bases: :py:obj:`Database`


   Impact proxies are datasets used to generate impacts without communicating with
   real biosphere flows and corresponding characterization factors. It can be used to
   easily import datasets from a database not compatible with Brightway by using
   another LCA software to do impact computation, or to use data from literature which
   are often given at the impact level, and not the LCI level.
   One proxy will be created for each LCIA method. Proxy's name is
   "{bw_method_name}_technosphere_proxy".

   Initializes a Database from its name and optionally its path.
   :param name: name of the database. Should be consistent with the name used in
   datasets.
   :param path: path of the database on disk.


   .. py:method:: execute_at_startup()

      Method to be executed when running Appa Build to import the database. Default
      behavior is to reset all params, and to run import method only if its not
      already present in Brightway project.
      :return:



   .. py:method:: import_in_project() -> None

      For each LCIA method, one dataset will be created with type biosphere, and
      another one with type technosphere which will have one unit of the corresponding
      biosphere proxy as input exchange. Both are necessary as characterization factor
      has to be connected with a biosphere dataset, and a technosphere dataset is
      necessary to be used by other technosphere datasets.
      A characterization factor of one is then added between each method and the
      corresponding proxy.
